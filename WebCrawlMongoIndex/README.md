#WebCrawlMongoIndex

This Project is my attempt to provide sollution for a coding challenge. The aim is to create a solution that crawls for articles from a news website, cleanses the response, stores in a mongo database then makes it available to search via an API.

## Approach

There are two sections in this problem.

  1. Web Crawling for Articles and storing them into Mongodb
  2. Providing and API to search articles

For Web Crawling, I have chosen [Apache Nuth](http://nutch.apache.org/)
